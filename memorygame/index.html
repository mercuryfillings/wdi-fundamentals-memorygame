		<p>Concrentation, also known as Real Rear Wheel, Irish Wristwatch, Red Letter Yellow Letter, or simply Rural Mural is a collectible card game in which several adult men huddle around a cheap plastic folding table in the back recesses of a dingy comic shop. The cards are expensive and I think they're coated in something funny, because my hands get really itchy when I play. All this considered, I can't recommend you start playing Concrentation, so here's a janky little memory game I cooked up to tide you over while you wait for your mom to come pick you up.</p>
